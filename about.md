## About Me
I am Rishi, a pre-final year student at BITS Hyderabad pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering(B.E) and Biological Sciences (M.Sc). You can find about my past and on-going projects on this website. My blogs are mostly personal opinions, but you may also find some research centric blogs about the human brain.

## Projects I have worked on / currently working on
1. Student's Anonymous  
2. Spectrum Edventures 
3. HowToCrackInterviews
4. W&H
5. One month with Ankur Warikoo
6. Case competitions in college
7. Zenskar
8. NeoVes (on going)
9. Research Intern at APU (on going)
10. Research Intern at BITS (on going)

I hope to research the human brain to understand mental health, trauma, neurological disorders and contribute in the reduction of suffering.

## More about me
Reading, writing and the gym is my definition of self care and good health. In April 2025 I started to learn Hindustani Classical music.
My interest spreads across research, writing and entrepreneurship. I hope to bring these 3 to an intersection.
